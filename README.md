# Title: Aviation-Accident-Analysis

## --------------------------------------------------
## Introduction
- As the company expands into the aviation industry, it seeks to purchase and operate aircraft for both commercial and private ventures. However, with no prior experience in the sector, the company must carefully assess potential risks associated with different aircraft types. Understanding historical accident data is crucial in determining which aircraft models offer the lowest risk, ensuring safety, regulatory compliance, and cost-effectiveness.

## Overview
- As the company expands into the aviation industry, it seeks to purchase and operate aircraft for both commercial and private ventures. However, with no prior experience in the sector, the company must carefully assess potential risks associated with different aircraft types. Understanding historical accident data is crucial in determining which aircraft models offer the lowest risk, ensuring safety, regulatory compliance, and cost-effectiveness

## Statement of the Problem
- Aircraft accidents can result from multiple factors, including mechanical failures, human error, and adverse weather conditions. Analyzing historical data will help identify patterns in past incidents, providing valuable insights for risk assessment. The company must evaluate different aircraft models, manufacturers, and operational conditions to minimize the likelihood of accidents and improve decision-making regarding fleet acquisition.

## Objectives 
### 1. General Objetive: 
- To identify the safest and most reliable aircraft for commercial and private operations by analysing historical accident data, assessing risk factors, and providing actionable insights for informed decision-making.

### 2. Specific Objectives
- (i) Examine historical accident data to identify aircraft models with the lowest accident and fatality rates.

- (ii) Assess how factors such as aircraft age, manufacturer, engine type, and passenger capacity influence accident frequency and severity.

- (iii) Determine how different weather conditions and regions contribute to aircraft accidents and identify aircraft best suited for various environments.

## Data Understanding
## Data Understanding: Columns and Their Relevance
##### Date, Location, Country:

- Helps identify trends over time and geographical hotspots for accidents. Useful for assessing how accident frequency varies by region.

##### DamageLevel:

- Determines the severity of accidents, ranging from minor damage to complete destruction. Crucial for evaluating the resilience of different aircraft models.

##### TypeOfAircraft & Manufacturer:

- Essential for identifying which aircraft models and manufacturers have the highest or lowest accident rates. Helps in selecting aircraft with strong safety records. 

##### Built & Engines:

- The age of an aircraft and its engine type can impact its reliability and accident risk.
Helps determine whether older models or specific engine configurations are riskier.

##### Passengers, Fatal-Injuries, Serious-Injuries, Minor-Injuries, Uninjured:

- Provides insight into accident severity and survival rates. Essential for assessing passenger safety across different aircraft.

##### Weather-Condition:

- Helps evaluate how environmental factors contribute to accidents. Useful for identifying whether certain aircraft perform better in adverse conditions.

##### Flight.Phase:

- Identifies at what stage of flight (takeoff, cruise, landing, etc.) accidents occur most frequently.
Assists in understanding operational risks.

##### Latitude, Longitude:

- Geospatial data that helps map accident locations for further analysis.Useful for identifying high-risk areas and air traffic patterns.

#### Anticipated Expectations

- Identifying Low-Risk Aircraft Models: The analysis should highlight which aircraft models have historically lower accident rates.

- Understanding Common Risk Factors: Determining key contributors to accidents, such as specific flight phases, weather conditions, or maintenance issues.

- Data-Driven Decision-Making: Ensuring that aircraft purchases align with safety and operational efficiency by using historical data.

- Regulatory Compliance and Safety Standards: Ensuring the fleet meets industry safety regulations to avoid legal and financial liabilities.

- By leveraging this dataset, the company can make informed decisions about its aircraft selection, reducing operational risks while prioritizing passenger safety and business sustainability.
