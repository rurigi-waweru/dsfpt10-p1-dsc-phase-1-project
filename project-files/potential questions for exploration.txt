General Safety & Risk Assessment
--------------------------------
1. Which aircraft models have the lowest accident rates?
2. How does the accident rate vary between commercial and private aircraft?
3. Which manufacturers have the best safety records based on historical data?
4. What is the relationship between aircraft age and accident occurrence?
5. Are there specific flight phases (e.g., takeoff, landing) where certain aircraft are more prone to accidents?

Aircraft Design & Performance
-----------------------------
6. How does the number of engines impact accident frequency and severity?
7. Do larger aircraft (higher passenger capacity) have more or fewer accidents per flight compared to smaller aircraft?
8. Are there specific aircraft types (jet vs. turboprop) that have lower risk levels in commercial vs. private operations?
Geographic & Operational Considerations
9. In which countries or regions do most accidents occur, and what aircraft are commonly involved?
10. How do different weather conditions affect accident rates for different aircraft?
11. Do certain aircraft types perform better in specific climates or geographic regions?

Injury & Damage Analysis
--------------------------------
12. Which aircraft have the lowest fatality rates in past accidents?
13. What is the correlation between aircraft type and the severity of injuries (fatal, serious, minor, uninjured)?
14. How often do specific aircraft sustain irreparable damage in accidents?
Regulatory & Financial Considerations
15. How do different aircraft models compare in terms of safety regulations and compliance?
16. Which aircraft require the least amount of maintenance to maintain high safety levels?
17. What is the long-term cost of operating different aircraft in terms of repairs and insurance based on accident history?
